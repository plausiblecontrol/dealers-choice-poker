# House Rules to Consider:
### Ante
* House determines the minimum Ante, and what an Ante means for gameplay. e.g. An Ante sets the minimum bet for the round and it buys the player into the round if they want to play the chosen game.

### Blinds
* House determines if the Ante is insufficient to stock the pot and wants to require play with Blinds. Considering Small and Big blinds to help force players to stay vested in the round.

### Burn Cards
* House should consider when and how to burn cards for play. This can help force a more blended card deal, but should consider player count as it can empty a deck quick.

### Bounty
* House considers punishing a player that repeatedly wins. A die is needed to track maintenance. A predetermined amount is decided by the house for increment value (generally minimum, e.g. a Dime). 
  * When someone wins a round they receive the die and set it to '1'. They also receive everything currently in the Bounty pot. 
  * If a person wins while holding the die, they pay the increment value X times the amount shown on the die to the Bounty pot. They also increment the die's shown value up to it's limit of '6'. The die never increments over 6.

### Wild Handling
* House determines validity for 5-of-a-kind and unique wild representation.

### Maximum Betting
* House should consider how to and whether to impose a maximum wager and what to set it to.

### Check-Raise
* House should consider whether or not to allow Check-Raises. If not allowed, this forces players that check to only Call or Fold.

### Allowed and Repeat Games
* House should consider whether or not to allow repeat games, what an allowed game list may include, and how choices can be made.

### Chip Accounting
* House should determine how chips may be exchanged for smaller or larger denominations.
* House should consider when players are allowed to exchange personal chips with chips currently present in the pot (i.e. Player exchanges 5 nickels in the pot for their own quarter when it is not their turn to bet).
